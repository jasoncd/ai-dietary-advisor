# Fix Render Deployment - Avoid Docker Issues

The build failed because Render is using Docker which doesn't include development dependencies needed for building.

## Solution: Configure Render for Node.js (Not Docker)

### Step 1: Delete Web Service (If Created)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. If you created a web service, delete it
3. Keep the PostgreSQL database

### Step 2: Create New Web Service (Correct Settings)
1. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
2. Connect GitHub repository: `jasoncd/ai-dietary-advisor`
3. **Important Settings**:
   - **Environment**: Node (NOT Docker)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Node Version**: 18
   - **Instance Type**: Free

### Step 3: Environment Variables
1. Add these environment variables:
   - **DATABASE_URL**: [your PostgreSQL URL]
   - **NODE_ENV**: `production`

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service"

## Why This Works:
- Node environment includes all dependencies
- Avoids Docker's production-only dependency issues
- Your build process works correctly
- All development tools (vite, esbuild) are available during build
